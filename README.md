## Project Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
2. Preprocessing and encoding categorical features  
3. Train/Test split  
4. Train multiple models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
5. Evaluate models (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²)  
6. Feature Importance visualization  
7. Sample prediction for a student  
8. Save the best model  
9. Actual vs Predicted plot
